# Arduino-Obstacle-Avoiding-Remote-Control-car

## About the project
This remote control arduino obstacle avoiding car can be controlled via a bluetooth remote or any android phone from a distance. Making this a great use for entartainment & a great aparautus for rescue mission also. 

This system cana be also used to avoid and reduce accedent rate by detecting obstaacle and avoiding them or/and braking automatically.

Now at first and somtimes it is very hard and tricky to control this robot car as it it very fast and nimble so this ibstacle avoiding system is also a seafty feature for itself. So, it can detect and avoid obstacle to avoid damages to itself.
